# Electric-tricycle

The present project aims to develop a smart electric tricycle in order to provide certain travel
autonomy and safety for handicapped people. Certain level of intelligence is added to the 
tricycle using Arduino boards and various sensors. This project involves the use of a mobile 
application, installed on a smart phone, which allows controlling the speed and movement of 
the electric tricycle. An ultrasonic sensor is installed on the back of the tricycle, avoiding any 
shock with close obstacles. Moreover, a warning system is developed allowing sending, to a 
specific number, a rescue SMS with GPS coordinates. The rescue message is sent when the 
handicapped person presses a button and that when any problem occurs. Furthermore, an 
automatic lighting system is developed to turn on the projector when the light goes below the 
visible region of our eyes, e.g., in a tunnel, in a garage or in the night. Finally, we investigate 
renewable energy, i.e., the solar panels, in order to charge the batteries of the electric tricycle.
